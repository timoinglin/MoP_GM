# MoP_GM

[![Latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/timoinglin/MoP_GM?style=flat-square&color=33aa33)](https://github.com/timoinglin/MoP_GM/releases/latest)
[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/timoinglin/MoP_GM/total?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/timoinglin/MoP_GM/releases)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](LICENSE)
[![WoW client](https://img.shields.io/badge/WoW-5.4.8%20MoP-9534b1?style=flat-square)](https://www.emucoach.com/)

A clean, movable GM panel for **World of Warcraft Mists of Pandaria 5.4.8** private servers — built and tested against [Emucoach](https://www.emucoach.com/) repacks (TrinityCore-based).

Every common GM command is one click away, with input fields right next to each command. Every command has been **cross-checked against the server's `world.command` table** so the addon only exposes what actually works on your server.

### ⬇ [Download the latest release](https://github.com/timoinglin/MoP_GM/releases/latest/download/MoP_GM.zip)

> 💛 **Using the GM panel?** It's free and open-source, built and maintained in spare time. If it's saved you time managing your server — or you'd like to see it keep growing — a coffee genuinely helps. See [Support the Project](#support-the-project).

## Install

1. **Download** the zip: [MoP_GM.zip](https://github.com/timoinglin/MoP_GM/releases/latest/download/MoP_GM.zip)
2. **Extract** the `MoP_GM` folder into your client's AddOns directory:
   ```
   World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\MoP_GM\
   ```
   The folder must contain `MoP_GM.toc` directly — i.e. the path `…\Interface\AddOns\MoP_GM\MoP_GM.toc` should exist.
3. **Launch** the game. On the character-select screen, open **AddOns** and confirm `MoP_GM` is listed and enabled.
4. **Log in.** A small gear icon appears next to your minimap — click it to open the panel, or type `/gm` in chat.

> ℹ Your account needs the GM level required for the commands you intend to run. The addon doesn't elevate permissions — it just sends the chat lines on your behalf.

## How to use

| Action | Result |
|---|---|
| **Click** a command label | Runs the command using the values in the input fields |
| **Press Enter** in any input field | Runs the command for that row |
| **Hover** a command label | Shows the exact command it will send, its help text, and whether it asks for confirmation |
| **SHIFT-click** a command label | Drops the built command into the chat box to edit before sending (instead of running it) |
| **Right-click** any command label | Pin / unpin it from the **Favorites** tab |
| **SHIFT-drag** the minimap button | Move the launcher button anywhere on screen |
| **Drag the panel header** | Move the main panel |
| **Click the X** on the panel header | Close the panel |
| `/gm` *or* `/mopgm` | Toggle the panel |
| `/mopgm reset` | Recenter panel and minimap button |
| `/mopgm debug` | Print module load status (for troubleshooting) |
| `/mopgm probe <command>` | Send a chat command and capture its server response inline |

Destructive commands (ban, kick, server shutdown, reset, delete, …) show a confirmation popup before sending.

The panel header shows your **current target** — handy because many commands act on the selected unit when their name field is left blank.

### 💾 Character backup & transfer with `.pdump`

`.pdump write` (Server ▸ Status) creates a **complete, portable dump of a single character** — not just the `characters` row. It captures everything that character owns and knows in one self-contained `.sql` file:

> items & where they sit (bags / bank / equipped), inventory, spells, talents, glyphs, skills, action bars, currencies, reputations, achievements & progress, completed quests, homebind, and more — only the tables that character actually has data in. A played character routinely dumps **hundreds of rows across a dozen-plus tables**.

`.pdump load <file> <account>` recreates that whole character on any account — **GUIDs and item GUIDs are remapped automatically**, so it never collides with existing characters or items. That makes it perfect for:

- **Backups** — snapshot a character before a risky change, restore it if something breaks.
- **Transfers** — move a character to another account, realm, or even a different server.
- **Templates** — dump a fully-geared character and load copies onto multiple accounts.

It's character-scoped, so it does **not** carry the account itself or its other characters. Nothing touches the live database until you run `.pdump load`.

> ℹ **Where does the file go?** It's written on the **server host**, in the worldserver's working directory (next to `worldserver.exe`) when you pass a plain filename — e.g. `.pdump write bob.sql Bob`. Give an absolute path (e.g. `.pdump write C:\dumps\bob.sql Bob`) to write elsewhere; the folder must already exist. `.pdump load` looks for the file the same way.

---

## Compatibility

- WoW client **5.4.8** (interface 50400). It will not load on other clients without changing the TOC.
- Designed for **TrinityCore-based** servers (Emucoach, TwinStar, etc.). Every command is sent as a regular chat message; the server intercepts dot-commands before broadcasting.
- No external libraries — uses only the built-in WoW UI APIs available in 5.4.8.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Something looks wrong** — run `/mopgm debug`. It prints whether each module loaded and whether the main frame and toggle button were created. If any module shows `MISSING`, that file failed to load — copy the output and [open an issue](https://github.com/timoinglin/MoP_GM/issues).
- **Toggle button is off-screen / behind the minimap** — run `/mopgm reset` to recenter both the panel and the launcher button.
- **A button doesn't work on your server** — run `/mopgm probe <command>` (e.g. `/mopgm probe .additem 6948 1`) to capture the server's response inline. If your server returns "no such command" or "no such subcommand", that command isn't installed on your repack — open an issue with the probe output and we'll adjust the addon.
